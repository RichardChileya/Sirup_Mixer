# Sirup_Mixer
Sirup Dilution Calculator is a Python program that allows users to calculate the amount of syrup they need to replace with water to achieve a recommended dilution. Users can input the amount of syrup in their glass, the current dilution, and the recommended dilution. 

## How it Works

- - The `sirup_replacement` function has three parameters: `syrup_in_glass`, `current_dilution`, and `recommended_dilution`.
- The function calculates the amount of syrup that needs to be replaced based on the user's input.
- The calculated value of `syrup_to_replace` is returned by the function.
- The user inputs the amount of syrup in their glass, the current dilution of the syrup, and the recommended dilution.

## Usage

- Ensure that Python is installed on your computer before using the code.
- Open a Python environment or IDE and copy/paste the provided code.
- Run the code and enter the necessary information when prompted.
- The program will calculate and display the amount of syrup to replace with water.
- Experiment with different values to observe changes in the syrup replacement amount.
